In this folder I try to replicate the experiments from Deistler et al. 2024 with the sOnalpha RGC.
- train.py contains the main training script.
- simulate.py contains the code for creating the predictions from the bipolar cell input currents. Its functions are imported in train.py.
- the scripts and notebooks starting with numbers (eg 01_setup.py)  are part of the data preprocessing pipeline.
